Nullsans
300 times…

The actor came into this world.
300 times…
He slaughtered all his friends. He tried different ways each time.
He mixed up the files. He changed the codes.
He memorized the rules... and then forgot them.
But one person did not forget.

Sans, he waited every time.

At first he was just tired.
He was furious afterwards.
After a while, he didn't feel anything.
But 300. after the trial…
He began to feel sans.

Something was wrong.
After each reset, while the memories should have gone, some pieces remained.
The voice of Papyrus, who was dying before his eyes, was sometimes echoed, sometimes mingled with a hoarse laugh.
Sans's mind no longer carried two personalities: one still wanted to forget, while the other remembered everything.

And one day, the remembering party dived into the files.

save.dat... system/core/soul_index... player_path.txt...
He discovered a void where he could look into everything.
There was an opening in this gap.
A salvation.

But to trigger this deficit... the player had to die once again.
This time is the last time. Really this time.

And so Sans stopped stopping.
He stopped talking.
He just waited.
He just attacked.

Lasers, bones, endless loop…
With every step, with every decision, there was a flood of anger raining down on the player.
This was no longer justice. It was an effort to save himself.

The actress tried again more than 300 times.
Sans waited at the same spot each time.
But this Sans was different now.
There was no light in his eyes,
There was no humor in his voice,
There was no humanity left in his soul.

He was no longer a character, but a null variable that had awakened in the system.
He didn't have a name.
His identity had been erased.
But the purpose was clear:

To stop the player.
And triggering the deficit.
To get rid of the endless cycle.

The End of NULLSANS
And when the last stroke came...
Everything froze.
The screen went dark.
A message appeared:

“...EXIT SIGNAL DETECTED...”

“/null/sans successfully terminated instance: PLAYER”

"System freed from recursion.”

“Goodbye.”

And since then, no one has been able to turn on that game again.
Because there is no determination in it,
a will had been awakened.
